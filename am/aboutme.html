            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Hey! I'm Hutlaw, a high school student with a passion for all things tech. I started out in game development and 3D modeling, but lately, I've been diving deep into software and web development. It's been an exciting shift, and I'm loving every bit of it.</p>

            <h3>Future Plans</h3>
            <p>Right now, my plan is to finish high school, join the Navy Reserves, and then head to Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona to study something like UAS, Cybersecurity, or Homeland Security. After college, I'm thinking of going back into the Navy full-time.</p>

            <h3>Profession/Hobbies</h3>
            <p>I'm still a high school student, but in my free time, I’m all about software development, web design, and gaming. I might have started with game development, but now I’m finding new challenges in creating websites and apps.</p>

            <h3>Game Development Experience</h3>
            <p>Game development and 3D modeling were where I first found my creative spark. It taught me so much about problem-solving and thinking outside the box. While I’m not actively working on games right now, those skills still help me in software and web development today.</p>

            <h3>Current Focus & Goals</h3>
            <p>These days, I’m diving headfirst into software and web development, aiming to build stuff that's user-friendly, functional, and just looks great. I also have dreams of traveling – Japan, Canada, and Bolivia are at the top of my list!</p>
