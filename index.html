      <h3>Game Development</h3>
      <p>I got into game development and 3D modeling because I saw how amazing games were but their would always be somthing missing from it that i wanted. Being a game developer i would be able to make what ever i want and have it include all the features i want. Another reason is i want to make the best game, a game that will take the internet by storm just like Undertale did, and game that will be enjoyed to play for years to come.</p>

Some other smaller dreams are being able to pet a red panda, those things are so adorbable but i never seen one in real life.</p>
