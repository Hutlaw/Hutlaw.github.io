      <h3>Game Development</h3>
      <p>I got into game development and 3D modeling because I saw how amazing games were, but there would always be something missing from it that I wanted. Being a game developer, I would be able to make whatever I want and have it include all the features I want. Another reason is I want to make the best game, a game that will take the internet by storm just like Undertale did, a game that will be enjoyed to play for years to come.</p>

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <p>I have a lot of goals, or dreams as some other people may call it. I want to be able to travel, which is my biggest goal. Be able to see the world like Japan, Canada, or Bolivia. There are so many cool places, and I want to be able to capture them all. Some other smaller dreams are being able to pet a red panda; those things are so adorable but I never seen one in real life.</p>
